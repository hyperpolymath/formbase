The open-source Airtable alternative that remembers everything.

== What is FormBase?

FormBase is a spreadsheet-database hybrid built on link:https://github.com/hyperpolymath/formdb[FormDB]. Unlike traditional spreadsheet tools, every change is tracked with who made it, when, and why.

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Feature | Description

| *Provenance by default*
| Every cell change records who, when, and why - not optional

| *Full reversibility*

== FormDB Superpowers

These features are unique to FormBase because of the FormDB backend:

=== Provenance View
Click any cell to see its complete history: who changed it, when, and their stated rationale.

=== Time Travel
View your entire base at any point in history. Compare snapshots.

=== PROMPT Scores
Rate data quality on six dimensions: Provenance, Replicability, Objectivity, Methodology, Publication, Transparency.

=== Proof Export
Generate audit-grade documentation with cryptographic proofs of data integrity.

=== DOI Linking
Link records to canonical sources. DOI-linked records are immutable; edits create "play variants."
